title: Welcome to my site

Here, you'll find posts and notes on topics that interest me. Take a look around. I'll primarily use this site to hold myself accountable for writing about subjects I'm learning or things I'm currently working on.


Some useful links, 

- [Posts](/posts/): a collection of my posts;
- [Notes](/notes/): a collection of my notes;

I also set up my own gitea server, <a href="https://git.emanuelrgz.com/" target="_blank">git.emanuelrgz.com</a>
