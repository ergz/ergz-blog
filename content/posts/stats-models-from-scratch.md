title: Statistical Models from Scratch

So I want to try and write a few statistical models from scratch in C. For now I will tackle two simple models

- Univariate Linear Regression 
- Univariate Logistic Regression

These will include an easy to use interface, I could pontially also try and connect to them to have R as a frontend.

I will most likely keep work in progress log of these in the [[notes/]] section, but will compile well written progress
updates here in the [[posts/]]. I will tag these posts with #stats-from-scratch
