Hello everyone, my name is Emanuel Rodriguez. I am a statistician currently focusing on its application to ecology and the environmental sciences. I also enjoy programming, as a statistician I use a lot of R and Python, in my free time I like to write most of my projects in C (still a beginner) and Python. 

Outside of the technical work I enjoy playing guitar and synthesizers. I love playing telecasters and SGâ€™s, as far as synths I love Roland synths, I currently own a System 8 and mostly stick to the Juno 8 emulation.
