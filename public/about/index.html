I also enjoy programming, as a statistician I use a lot of R and Python, in my free time I like to write most of my projects in C (still a beginner) and Python.
Outside of the technical work I enjoy playing guitar and synthesizers. I love playing telecasters and SG’s, as far as synths I love Roland synths, I currently own a System 8 and mostly stick to the Juno 8 emulation." />
