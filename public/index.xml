      <description>Hello everyone, my name is Emanuel Rodriguez. I am a statistician currently focusing on its application to ecology and the environmental sciences. I also enjoy programming, as a statistician I use a lot of R and Python, in my free time I like to write most of my projects in C (still a beginner) and Python.
Outside of the technical work I enjoy playing guitar and synthesizers. I love playing telecasters and SGâ€™s, as far as synths I love Roland synths, I currently own a System 8 and mostly stick to the Juno 8 emulation.</description>

      <description>The plan for this site is to have an archive of my work, ideas and research. It is my intention to write good articles about my work and potentially upload some stuff about hobbies.</description>
